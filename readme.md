# Tom's data onion solution

This is a working solution to the puzzle in C#. 

There were already several open source solutions for Tom's Data Onion at the time of writing, but I wrote this one completely independently of them.

The code requires Dotnet Core 3.1 or higher. Use "runme.sh" or "runme.bat" to run everything. The coding style is just relaxed and practical.

Many thanks to Tom Dalling for creating the puzzle!
